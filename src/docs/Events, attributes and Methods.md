## Unleash the Power of Events and Attributes!
Hey there, fellow developer! Brace yourself as we dive into the world of ng-plyr events and attributes that will level up your video player game in Angular!

### ðŸŽ¬ Input Attributes ðŸŽ¬
The `<ng-plyr>` tag offers an array of input attributes, giving you the flexibility to fine-tune your media playback experience:

- **src**: Provide the URL of the media source to display your video or audio content.
- **preload**: Define when do you want to fetch video and/or its metadata. Same as HTML video tag's preload Attribute.
- **loadingImgSrc**: Set a custom loading image to charm your users while the media loads.
- **playFrom**: Start playing your media from a specific second to get the perfect playback.
- **volume**: Control the volume level and set it just right for your users.
- **loop**: Enable or disable looping so that the media plays from the beginning or stops at the end.
- **bookmarks**: Highlight specific seconds within the media's duration for easy navigation.
- **autoplay**: Decide whether your media starts playing automatically or waits for a user command.
- **nextMedia**: Define the media that should play next, making your playlist even more engaging.
- **playlist**: Pass an entire playlist to delight your users with continuous playback.
- **loopPlaylist**: Turn on the playlist loop to keep the fun going endlessly.
- **poster**: Greet your users with an awesome video poster.

### ðŸŽ‰ Output Events ðŸŽ‰
Get ready for the excitement of ng-plyr's output events, providing you with valuable information about your media playback:

- **playing**: Celebrate as the media starts to play, giving life to your content.
- **paused**: Pause for applause when the media takes a break.
- **ended**: Cue the applause again when the media ends its show.
- **onnext**: Stay ahead by knowing which media is set to play next in your playlist.
- **onprev**: Rewind and take a bow as the previous media steps into the spotlight.
- **fullscreen**: Feel the magic of entering or exiting fullscreen mode.

### ðŸš€ Upcoming Inputs and Output Events ðŸš€
We're always upgrading ng-plyr to offer you more exciting features! Keep an eye out for these upcoming additions:

- **type**: Specify the media type to enhance playback versatility.
- **captions**: Enrich your media experience with captions in different languages.

The excitement doesn't stop there! Be prepared for the error event, which will provide you with vital details about any errors that might occur.
